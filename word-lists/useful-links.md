How to Memorize a Random 60-Bit String

Abstract: User-generated passwords tend to be memorable,but not secure. A random, computer generated 60-bit string is much more secure.However, users cannot memorize random 60-bit strings. In this paper, we investigate methodsfor converting arbitrary bit strings into Englishword sequences (both prose and poetry),and we study their memorability and otherproperties.

The CMU Pronouncing Dictionary

http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict

The Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary is an open-source machine-readable pronunciation dictionary for North American English that contains over 134,000 words and their pronunciations. CMUdict is being actively maintained and expanded. We are open to suggestions, corrections and other input.


Its entries are particularly useful for speech recognition and synthesis, as it has mappings from words to their pronunciations in the ARPAbet phoneme set, a standard for English pronunciation. The current phoneme set contains 39 phonemes, vowels carry a lexical stress marker:


0    — No stress
1    — Primary stress
2    — Secondary stress


Bear in mind that this is a dictionary. If your word is not in it (or was misspelled) nothing will be returned. This applies to items such as numbers. This tool will try to come up with pronunciations for words not in the dictionary.

tokenGen: Generating High-Entropy Passphrases by Approximating an Individual’s Vocabulary


Mark Xue


Abstract: By generating suitably large vocabulary lists, we can make it feasible for a person to memorize a high-entropy password of drawn from a space of 75-128 bits.

Passwords and the Evolution of Imperfect Authentication

Abstract: Theory on passwords has lagged behind practice, where large providers useback-end smarts to survive with imperfect technology. Simplistic models of userand attacker behaviors have led the research community to emphasize the wrongthreats. Authentication is a classification problem amenable to machine learning,with many signals in addition to the password available to large Web services. Passwordswill continue as a useful signal for the foreseeable future, where the goal is not impregnable security but reducing harm at acceptable cost.
