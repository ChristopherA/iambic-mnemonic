Monosyllabic words cause trouble, because theirstress often depends on context (Greene et al., 2010). For example, eighth is stressed in eighth street, butnot in eighth avenue. This makes it hard to guaranteethat automatically-generated lines will scan asintended. We therefore eject all monosyllabic words (using http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict) from the vocabulary, except for six unstressed ones (a, an, and, the, of, or).
